**Testing Only** -- This branch contains some new rc service script ideas for Home Assisatnt Core. Both overlay folders should provide the same end result. I'm not sure which way to go just yet. I like the `overlay_combined` because, it's just one file. But I like `overlay_split` becasue, everything of else...

See [temp3 wiki page](https://github.com/tprelog/iocage-homeassistant/wiki/temp3) for testing this branch. Missing links refer to files found here
